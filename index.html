    <h2>About Us.</h2>
      <br>
    <p>Zenification is the art of molding your life to achieve zen, the ultimate experience of inner peace.</p>
      <br><br>
    <h4>A Calm Mind Is a Powerful Mind</h4>
      <br>
<p>It is a great asset and advantage to be able to silence the mind when its services are not required. A person who can silence the inner chatter of his mind is free from worries, anxieties and fears.</p>
<br>
<p>Making the mind peaceful and free from the compulsion of incessant thinking is possible, provided the proper training is undertaken. With the proper method and exercises, everyone can attain at least some measure of inner peace and mental mastery.</p>
<br>
<p>True control the mind is not just the ability to concentrate on one thought and disregard other thoughts. It is the ability to cleanse the mind completely and make it silent. This silence brings peace, contentment, happiness and bliss. This silence is not the silence of sleep. It is the silence of power, happiness, and enhanced awareness.</p>
